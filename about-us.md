## Who we are

We are a pre-seed non-profit organization working on building the internet's native identity layer. We are incorporated in the United States and are pending 501(c)3 status. As such, all of our activities ultimately benefit the public, as can be observed from our causes and activities below.

## Our vision

> **Universal Identity as the internet's native identity protocol enabling majority of digital activities and transactions.**

We believe Universal Identity will complement and enhance the web the same way the world wide web evolved the internet.

## Our mission

> **We work to enhance everyone's digital lives through inter-operability, privacy, security, and consumer choice.**

## Our approach

Universal Identity starts with the idea that ["The internet should have a native identity layer"↗️](https://medium.com/universal-identity/the-internets-missing-identity-layer-3934b23b6c22), that similar to the web, should be a usable public good. It then focuses on the people and organizations that the technology is setting out to serve, defines the solution from their point of view, and works its way back through the various business and technology implications. See ["Why Universal Identity?"↗️](https://medium.com/universal-identity/why-universal-identity-ad78ebb59aa7) for more details.
