## Problem: **Digital identity fragmentation**

- 🙍‍♀️ **Broken consumer experiences**
  - *️⃣ Managing so many passwords.
  - 🦸‍♀️ Privacy issues and personal data management.
  - 🤦‍♀️ Friction and limitations across services, devices, ecosystems and use-cases.
- ✅ **Customer verification challenges** - Multi-billion dollar Identity Access Management (IAM) and Identity Verification industries address the need in an inefficient way.
- 🧪 **Innovation roadblocks** - Fragmented identity silos, each controlled by a large player, adds significant friction to adoption of innovative new services.
- 🏢 **Broken business models** - Allows certain players to lock consumers and businesses in, such that innovative business models cannot emerge, preventing others from capture any of their own value.

## Solution: **Universal identity protocol**

- 🤳 **Self-sovereign** - Controlled by the ID owners.
- 📜 **Standards-based** - Based on a ubiquitous  common logical structure.
- 🔓 **Permissionless** - Allows everyone and anyone to innovate on top of it.
- 🔢 **Versioned** - Supports evolution through time, to cover increasing number of digital identity use cases.
- 🔗 **Federated** - When necessary, supports interoperability between different jurisdictional governance approaches.

## Goals

- **👥 Digital identity for the masses** - Provide everyday people with a usable (requiring minimal cognitive load) digital self-sovereign identity protocol and third-party identity apps.
- **🔒 Security** - Not only should the solution be technically secure against unauthorized exploits, it should also guarantee decentralization and protect against collusion by stakeholders to take advantage of others.
- **🕸 Decentralization** - Preventing of capture and rent-seeking behavior, the same behaviors that have fragmented Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 digital identity.
- **🦸‍♀️ Personal data privacy** - Identity owners are in full control of personal data and decide the extent to which it is shared. The choices are enforceable through social and national governance.
- **🌏 Ubiquitous adoption** - An identity protocol cannot be easy-to-use if it is not widely adopted by a network of people and organizations, and it is not widely adopted if doesn't grow past a tipping point, where mainstream digital ecosystem players are incentivized to support it.
- **🧠 Intuitiveness** - The standard concepts and protocol operation are in harmony with human cognitive models of identity, privacy and security.

## Protocol traits

- **↔️ Interoperable** - Entities functioning on the same protocol can interoperate seamlessly.
- **🔗 Federatable** - New instances of the protocol can be governed separately, while remaining interoperable with other instances, as long as both follow the same standards.
- **➡️ Transferrable** - Owner of a specific identity can easily transfer between different types of service providers.
- **🔓 Censorship resistant by default** - The protocols should allow anyone to participate by default.
- **🦸‍♂️ Privacy-enabled by default** - The protocols should allow the use of private (anonymous or pseudonymous) identities by default.
