## Goals

- **üë• Digital identity for the masses** - Provide everyday people with a usable (requiring minimal cognitive load) digital self-sovereign identity protocol and third-party identity apps.
- **üîí Security** - Not only should the solution be technically secure against unauthorized exploits, it should also guarantee decentralization and protect against collusion by stakeholders to take advantage of others.
- **üï∏ Decentralization** - Preventing of capture and rent-seeking behavior, the same behaviors that have fragmented Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 digital identity.
- **ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Personal data privacy** - Identity owners are in full control of personal data and decide the extent to which it is shared. The choices are enforceable through social and national governance.
- **üåè Ubiquitous adoption** - An identity protocol cannot be easy-to-use if it is not widely adopted by a network of people and organizations, and it is not widely adopted if doesn't grow past a tipping point, where mainstream digital ecosystem players are incentivized to support it.
- **üß† Intuitiveness** - The standard concepts and protocol operation are in harmony with human cognitive models of identity, privacy and security.

## Protocol traits

- **‚ÜîÔ∏è Interoperable** - Entities functioning on the same protocol can interoperate seamlessly.
- **üîó Federatable** - New instances of the protocol can be governed separately, while remaining interoperable with other instances, as long as both follow the same standards.
- **‚û°Ô∏è Transferrable** - Owner of a specific identity can easily transfer between different types of service providers.
- **üîì Censorship resistant by default** - The protocols should allow anyone to participate by default.
- **ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Privacy-enabled by default** - The protocols should allow the use of private (anonymous or pseudonymous) identities by default.
