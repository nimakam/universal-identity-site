# The idea

The idea of Universal Identity can best be explained in terms of problem and solution.

## Problem

The biggest part of the so called "identity problem" is the one that is out of plain sight. The biggest issue is the enormous macro-economic cost incurred on everyone using a fragmented collection of identity systems. Other problems can be limitations of existing technology around security, privacy and centralization, that need to be mitigated by a future solution.

### Fragmentation

Friction & non-interoperability across identity providers harms everyone including consumers, and incurres enormous macro economic costs.

The proliferation of identity systems, depending on user name and passwords, across service providers covering the many aspects of our digital lives, has made managing our credentials more and more difficult.

### Privacy

Suveillance and loss of personal info.

### Security

Hacked accounts, device, OS or App with the goal of gaining access, information or resources - Mass account hacks at the provider side are a high-scale special case.

### Monopoly

Often accompanies problems such as customer lock-in, rent-seeking, stifling innovation.

The digital technology industry partly consists of a number of monopolized sub-markets. Given that identity (amongst others such as data, connectivity, device and web user interfaces, etc) is a basic underlying layer of all technology products, identity systems are often used effectively to reinforce monopoly.

### Verification

Simulating a human being on the internet can be low cost, and can yield significant profit in various scenarios, such as product reviews, social media influence, political debates and voting, etc.

### Other problems

#### Political suppression

The power of government agencies such as intelligence, law enforcement and military are intentionallyconcentrated on aim of suppressing specific political movements through surveillance, threats and force.

#### Censorship

Denying access to citizens associated with undesirable groups or taking away their access to common platforms due to social and political pressure.

#### Recoverable events

Most Web 3.0 identity systems are vulnerable to unexpected loss events, and mitigate through less usable processes. Undesirable and unintended events such as loss of account, data, credentials or other artifacts that can be mitigated through a set of recovery steps.

## Solution

The final solution (Universal Identity system) is a distrbuted and decentralized identity system that supports private identities as well public ones, and can work in a hybrid manner offline, online and on-chain. This identity system functions according to a software protocol (Universal Identity protocol) designed to fulfill the requirements of the above solution.

### Password-less

Secure by default. No more guessing, or resetting countless passwords. Cryptographic keys are stored on your device hardware.

### Self-owned

You own and control your identity instead of that big tech company. You get to choose trusted services to operate your identity or switch anytime.

### Universal

One identity app, one collection of identities, one contact list, one privacy  source for all your digital and internet activities.

### Intuitive

Base on the human cognitive model of identity.

### Private

Supports private identities, privacy rules, and more.

### Open

Permission-less, and neutral like the internet & web.

### Hybrid

Supports offline, online and on-chain identities.
