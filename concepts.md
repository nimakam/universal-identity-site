# 🧠 Concepts

## Top level concepts

- 📜 Standard - The universal logical rules by which all system interactors play
- ⚙️ Protocol - running instance of standardized and distributed identity system
- 👩 User - Human represented by a digital identity, and with access to a device
- 👨‍✈️ Operator - Stores private user information partially or fully, may provide the user with a usable interface, and surface notifications.
  - ✅👨‍✈️ Designated operator - The operator responsible for providing the user with a graphical interface, and for delivering notifications.
- 🤖 Service agent - Represents digital entity of a non-user system.
- 🛡 Guardian - Is consulted in rare high impact potentially risky cases such as 1. loss of access 2. large transactions 3. succession events (like death or transition).
  - 🛡👨 Individual guardian
  - 🛡🏢 Guardian provider
- ✍️ Guarantor - Guarantees and verifies an identity and insures against a set of loss/harm criteria.
  - ✅ Verifier - Verifies identities and/or claims about identities.
