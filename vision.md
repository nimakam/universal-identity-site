# 👁 Vision

**The ubiquitious digital identity protocol for growing number of everyday use cases**

## Detailed vision statement

An **increasingly ubiquitous**, **digital identity** protocol, that empowers **consumers** to **use and manage their identity**, without involvement of a trusted **third party**, and that benefits other digital economy stakeholders such as businesses and governments.

## Problem: 🆔🧩 **Digital identity fragmentation**

- 🙍‍♀️🧩 **Broken consumer experiences**
  - 🗝 Managing so many passwords
  - 🦸‍♀️ Personal data management and privacy issues
  - 🤦‍♀️ Friction and limitations across services, devices, ecosystems and use-cases.
- 🏢🙍‍♀️✅ **Customer verification challenges** - Multi-billion dollar Identity Access Management (IAM) and Identity Verification industries address the need in an inefficient way.
- 📱🧪 **Innovation roadblocks** - Fragmented identity silos, each controlled by a large player, adds significant friction to adoption of innovative new services.
- 🏢🧩 **Broken business models** - Allows certain players to lock consumers and businesses in, such that innovative business models cannot emerge, preventing others from capture any of their own value.

## Solution: A 🌎🆔 **Universal identity protocol** that is

- 🤳 **Self-sovereign** - Controlled by ID owners
- 📜 **Standards-based** - Based on a ubiquitous  common logical structure
- 🔓 **Permissionless** - Allows everyone and anyone to innovate on top of it
- 🔢 **Versioned** - Supports evolution through time, to cover increasing number of digital identity use cases
- 🔗 **Federated** - When necessary, supports interoperability between different jurisdictional governance approaches

## 🎯 Goals

- **👥 Digital identity for the masses** - Provide everyday people with a usable (requiring minimal cognitive load) digital self-sovereign identity protocol and third-party identity apps.
- **🔒 Security** - Not only should the solution be technically secure against unauthorized exploits, it should also guarantee decentralization and protect against collusion by stakeholders to take advantage of others.
- **🕸 Decentralization** - Preventing of capture and rent-seeking behavior, the same behaviors that have fragmented Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 digital identity.
- **🦸‍♀️ Personal data privacy** - Identity owners are in full control of personal data and decide the extent to which it is shared. The choices are enforceable through social and national governance.
- **🌏 Ubiquitous adoption** - An identity protocol cannot be easy-to-use if it is not widely adopted by a network of people and organizations, and it is not widely adopted if doesn't grow past a tipping point, where mainstream digital ecosystem players are incentivized to support it.
- **🧠 Intuitiveness** - The standard concepts and protocol operation are in harmony with human cognitive models of identity, privacy and security.

## ☑️ Protocol traits

- **↔️ Interoperable** - Entities functioning on the same protocol can interoperate seamlessly.
- **🔗 Federatable** - New instances of the protocol can be governed separately, while remaining interoperable with other instances, as long as both follow the same standards.
- **➡️ Transferrable** - Owner of a specific identity can easily transfer between different types of service providers.
- **🔓 Censorship resistant by default** - The protocols should allow anyone to participate by default.
- **🦸‍♂️ Private identity supported by default** - The protocols should allow the use of private (anonymous or pseudonymous) identities by default.

## 🕰 Trend assumptions

- **🤳🆔 Self-sovereign identity** - Introduction of truly self-sovereign digital identity will disrupt all digital economic activity based on the following aspects:
  - **🙍‍♀️ Consumer experience** - The cost of managing passwords, personal data and privacy, as well as the friction consumer face across services, devices, ecosystems and use-cases.
    - **🗝 Passwords and accounts** - Passwords are no longer needed, and accounts are uniformly managed in the same place
    - **🦸‍♀️ Personal data and privacy** - We are in control of our own personal data and privacy. 
    - **🕸 Digital graph** - Having access to a universal graph of digital identities improves usability of digital artifact by orders of magnitude.
  - **🏢✅ Enterprise identity verification** - The large cost of economic activity related to Identity Access Management (IAM) and Identity Verification, can be significantly improved and disrupted.
  - **👩‍💻🏃‍♀️Software development limitations** - Current fragmented identity ecosystem, and lack of logical and programmatic uniformity drastically increases implementation complexity. With significantly improvements, development can scale and reduces total costs by orders of magnitude.
  - **👨‍💼🏃‍♂️ Business model limitations** - Current fragmented identity landscape, allows certain players to lock people in. Fixing this will allow disruptive business models to emerge, unlocking enormous economic value.
